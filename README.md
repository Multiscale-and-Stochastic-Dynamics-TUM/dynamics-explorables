ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸš§

## Development notes

### Installing all the things

The website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast static-site generator. You will need to install it if you want to build the project locally. For Debian systems, do 

```bash
sudo apt install hugo
```

For any other systems, refer to the official Hugo [installation guidelines](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

### Creating the website locally

To create the website, switch to the `dynamics-explorables` folder and start a Hugo server:

```bash
cd dynamics-explorables
hugo server
```

The website should open in your default browser automatically.
