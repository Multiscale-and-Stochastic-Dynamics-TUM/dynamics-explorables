Dynamics Explorables is a project developed at the chair of Multiscale and Stochastic Dynamics at the Technical University of Munich. The content is mainly based on the graduate-level course “Dynamical Systems” given by Prof. Christian Kuehn at TUM in the summer semester.

## Development notes

Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/Multiscale-and-Stochastic-Dynamics-TUM/dynamics-explorables/wiki) for any questions regarding the project. In particular, here are a few useful pages to get you started:
- [How to build the website locally](https://github.com/Multiscale-and-Stochastic-Dynamics-TUM/dynamics-explorables/wiki/How-to-build-the-website-locally)
- [How to add new content](https://github.com/Multiscale-and-Stochastic-Dynamics-TUM/dynamics-explorables/wiki/How-to-add-new-content)
- [How to deploy the website](https://github.com/Multiscale-and-Stochastic-Dynamics-TUM/dynamics-explorables/wiki/How-to-deploy-the-website)

In addition to that, the wiki collects our knowledge of the frameworks we use like [Hugo](https://github.com/Multiscale-and-Stochastic-Dynamics-TUM/dynamics-explorables/wiki/Hugo) and [Plotly](https://github.com/Multiscale-and-Stochastic-Dynamics-TUM/dynamics-explorables/wiki/Plotly). 

Before you push any changes, please read our short guideline on [git workflows](https://github.com/Multiscale-and-Stochastic-Dynamics-TUM/dynamics-explorables/wiki/Git-workflows).

## Questions & bug reports

Noticed any bugs or errors? Found a typo in the text? The simulations do not work on your browser or look weird on mobile? Please post a new issue here on GitHub. Feel free to post even about minor tweaks or suggestions – this helps us make the project better! 

We don't have a template for new issues, but it would help us if you included a detailed description of the problem, some information about your system and browser, and a few screenshots.
