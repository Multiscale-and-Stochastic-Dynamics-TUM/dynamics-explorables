Dynamics Explorables is a project developed at the chair of [Multiscale and Stochastic Dynamics](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/math/research/groups/multiscale-stochastic-dynamics/) at the TU Munich. The content is mainly based on the graduate-level course "Dynamical Systems" given by Prof. Christian Kuehn at TUM in the summer semester. 

Want to learn more about dynamical systems and the models covered here? Here are some helpful resources:

### Lectures
* If you are a TUM student, attend the Dynamical Systems lecture. ðŸ˜‰

### Textbooks
* M. Brin, Introduction to dynamical systems
* Yu. Kuznetsov, Elements of Applied Bifurcation Theory
* S. Strogatz, Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos
* S. Wiggins, Introduction to Applied Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Chaos
