Dynamics Explorables is a project developed at the chair of [Multiscale and Stochastic Dynamics](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/math/research/groups/multiscale-stochastic-dynamics/) at the TU Munich. The content is based on the Dynamical Systems lecture given by Prof. Christian Kuehn in the summer semester.

### Bug reports
Noticed any bugs or errors? Found a typo in the text? The simulations do not work on your browser or look weird on mobile? Please post a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Multiscale-and-Stochastic-Dynamics-TUM/dynamics-explorables). Thank you for helping to make the project better!

TODO: do we want to put here any other contacts?
