The system we look at in the example is a continuous-time two dimentional system generated by the following ODE:
$$\begin{pmatrix} \dot x \newline \dot y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x \newline -y + x^2 \end{pmatrix},$$
with the equilibrium, $x_\*$, at the origin. As seen previously linearization is a good starting point to analize a given dynamical system. The jacobian at the origin is the matrix $Df (\textbf{0})$:
$$Df (\textbf{0}) = \begin{pmatrix}  
1 & 0\newline
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}$$
If $Df (x_\*)$ has no eigenvalues with the real parts equal to zero, the point $x_\*$ is called hyperbolic.
In the demonstration above we first define the linearized system on the phase space. It has a hyperbolic eqilibrium, as seen from $Df (\textbf{0})$.
You can put a point by clicking the phase space and evolve it by pressing "Play". 
Try different initial conditions and see if their trajectories (orbits) follow any patterns.
